"""
This file has two parts, the first one contains pseudoconstants to get
permissions titles in other places.

The second part is a function to set up permissions for some general objects.

All the available permissions are defined in permissions.zcml.
Each permission has two attributes: a short ID and a long title. The ID
will be used for zope3-like permissions such as ZCML configuration
files. The long title will be used for zope2-like
permissions such as sm.checkPermission.

In order to avoid typo errors, we will use pseudoconstants instead of
permission string values. these constants are defined in ins this file.

The two files (permissions.py and permissions.zcml) must be kept in sync.

bika.lims.__init__ imports * from this file, so
bika.lims.PermName or bika.lims.permissions.PermName are
both valid.
"""

# Add Permissions
# ===============
# For "Add" permissions, keep the name of the variable as "Add<portal_type>".
# When the module gets initialized (bika.lims.__init__), the function initialize
# will look through these Add permissions attributes when registering types and
# will automatically associate them with their types.
